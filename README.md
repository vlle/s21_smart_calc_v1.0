# s21_smart_calc_v1.0
Calculator based on GTK 4 &amp; C with finance support

## Prerequisites:
1. GTK 4
2. check.h library for unit-testing
3. pkg-config
4. gcc/clang with C11 support

## How to build:
`cd src` && `make launch`

## What it does?

It's a calculator. It can count usual numbers, trig funcs, ln-log, sqrt, power, etc.
There's a support for an unary minus and multiple brackets too.

## How it looks?
![](<img/basic_calc.png>)
![](<img/finance_calcus.png>)
Like that.

## What to improve?

Work with cairo library and gtk codebase. Everything other is okay I guess.
